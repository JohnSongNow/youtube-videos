## Youtube Videos

## Introduction

I created this repo called `Piro` store help me store any visualizations I've created for my YouTube videos on my channel [JohnSongNow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCycdC7boSr9MB-_5ba-C8MA). I create visualizations using Unity as a way of better teaching concepts that I talk about in my videos. The visualizations in this repo use a tool called [Piro](https://github.com/JohnSongNow/Piro) to manage and create cutscene/cinematic. If you're curious about running the videos yourself you can run and edit the cinematics yourself. 

Originally I wrote a similar code back there in [Godot](https://godotengine.org) used an earlier pathfinding and parallel programming videos. I've since then ported the tool into Unity as a modernization process. For a tutorial on how to run the visualizations yourself please see either the [Piro](https://github.com/JohnSongNow/Piro) or [Godot Video Tools](https://github.com/JohnSongNow/godot-video-tools) page. 

## Running the cinematics

Most of the current videos are made using a unity tool called [Piro](https://github.com/JohnSongNow/Piro). With the exception of the `Pathfinding` and `Parallel Programming` video which use the older [Godot Video Tools](https://github.com/JohnSongNow/godot-video-tools) tool.
